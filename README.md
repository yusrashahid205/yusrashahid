#HELLO THERE
I am a second-year student of Computer System Engineering at Usman Institute of Technology. 
I am also a member of the IEEE UIT Student branch to polish my interpersonal skills.
I believe that Smart work and creativity are the two most important key aspects of defining who I am.
Besides, I aspire to be a freelance graphic designer. 
I am volunteering for different societies at my university as a graphic designer.
I am currently learning Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator but intend to learn other software as well.
I have also basic knowledge of python as well.
